  "interests": "The latest news in large language models (LLMs), electronics, PCB, and VLSI highlights significant advances in AI-driven design automation and efficiency improvements:\n\n- **LLMs**: New developments include RustGPT, a fully Rust-implemented LLM without external ML frameworks, emphasizing stable token-wise credit and training on entire data streams without heuristics. Pretraining efficiency is improving by combining ensembling and higher regularization, reducing data needs by 5\u00d7. The focus is shifting from deeper models to better interfaces emphasizing explainability and human feedback. Reinforcement learning is being applied directly on pretraining data to reduce reliance on human annotations. Switzerland released its first fully open-source multilingual LLM, expanding access to large-scale AI models[1][3][7].\n\n- **Electronics and Chip Design**: LLMs are increasingly integrated into chip design workflows to optimize, automate, and accelerate processes, especially in later implementation stages. Cadence\u2019s JedAI platform uses LLMs to assist engineers in design cleaning, validation, and specification reviews, saving hundreds of engineering hours and reducing bugs. AI is also transforming PCB design by automating complex layout and routing tasks, allowing engineers to focus more on system-level design and validation, which is critical given the complexity of modern PCBs with billions of transistors[2][4].\n\n- **PCB and Circuit Analysis**: AI-driven automation is enhancing PCB design complexity management and validation. TechInsights continues to advance circuit analysis capabilities with high-precision imaging and proprietary software for IC, package, PCB, and circuit-level reverse engineering, supporting a wide range of device types including analog, digital, RF, and power management ICs[2][6].\n\n- **VLSI and Semiconductor Industry**: Industry news includes ongoing efforts in thermal modeling for 3D IC packages, export controls on EDA tools, and strategic moves by major players like TSMC accelerating U.S. production and Synopsys-Ansys divestitures. The rise of RISC-V architecture and developments in chip packaging and lithography are also notable. AI chip sales to China have resumed amid geopolitical tensions, and new materials like SiC and GaN are expanding power device capabilities[8].\n\nThese trends collectively show a strong push toward AI-enhanced design automation in electronics and semiconductor fields, with LLMs playing a growing role in reducing human workload and improving design accuracy and efficiency.",
  "home_location": "Recent local news and updates for Kharar, Punjab, India, include:\n\n- The Punjab government has approved funds for repairing rural link roads in Kharar. The first phase covers repair of 30 roads totaling 60.48 km at a cost of Rs 15 crore, with work to be completed in six months. The second phase involves repairing 50 roads totaling 97.03 km for Rs 24 crore over 13 months. Additionally, approval was given for maintenance of 10 more roads totaling 30.12 km costing Rs 7.40 crore[1].\n\n- The Kharar-Landran road remains in poor condition with deep potholes causing frequent accidents and vehicles getting stuck, including tourist and CTU buses. Temporary fixes have failed, and the road is considered dangerous for two-wheeler riders[2].\n\n- Contractual employees of Punjab Roadways, PRTC, and PunBus protested at the Baba Banda Singh Bahadur ISBT in Phase 6, blocking the Kharar-Chandigarh highway for nearly two hours demanding regularisation of services and benefits. The protest caused major traffic jams on the highway and nearby roads[3].\n\n- Punjab Vigilance Bureau raided the residence and office of Kharar realtor and politician Ranjit Singh Gill shortly after he joined the BJP. The raids are viewed by his associates as political vendetta. Gill had unsuccessfully contested the Kharar Assembly seat in 2017 and 2022[5].\n\n- Anju Chander took charge as the Kharar Municipal Council chief following a no-confidence motion against the previous president[2].\n\nThese updates reflect ongoing infrastructure repairs, political developments, and civic issues in Kharar as of late 2025.",
  "work_location": "Recent local news and updates for IT Park, Chandigarh, India, include the following key developments:\n\n- The Chandigarh Housing Board (CHB) is set to **reboot its stalled housing scheme in IT Park**, now planning low-rise buildings instead of the earlier proposed seven-storey towers. The project, originally approved in 2020 for 728 flats, faced controversies including unauthorized spending and calls to return the land. The exact number of flats will be finalized after a consultant's report[1].\n\n- The Chandigarh administration has opposed allotting land in IT Park for a new Punjab and Haryana High Court complex, stating it would **violate land-use policies and wildlife protection norms**. Restrictions exist on high-rise construction in IT Park to protect migratory birds and the sanctuary nearby, as per the Master Plan-2031 and wildlife board notifications[4].\n\n- The Rajiv Gandhi Chandigarh Technology Park (RGCTP) continues to attract investment, with **\u20b91500 crore already invested** by the Chandigarh Administration and private companies, and an additional \u20b9500 crore expected soon[5].\n\nOther notable city-wide updates (not specific to IT Park but relevant to Chandigarh) include the launch of India\u2019s first **AI-driven smart parking system** by Chandigarh Municipal Corporation, covering 87 paid parking sites with real-time availability updates via sensors and cameras[2], and a new surface parking project near the Punjab and Haryana High Court to accommodate around 763 vehicles, expected to be implemented in phases[3].\n\nThese developments reflect ongoing urban planning, infrastructure upgrades, and regulatory challenges in and around IT Park, Chandigarh."
