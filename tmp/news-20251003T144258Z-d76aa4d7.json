    "interests": "The latest news in LLMs and AI highlights several key developments as of October 2025:\n\n- **Switzerland released Apertus**, its first large-scale, fully open-source multilingual large language model (LLM). Apertus is trained on 15 trillion tokens across over 1,000 languages, including Swiss German and Romansh, promoting linguistic diversity and digital sovereignty. Its architecture, training data, and model weights are fully transparent and publicly accessible under a permissive license. It is available via Swisscom\u2019s AI platform, Hugging Face, and the Public AI network[1].\n\n- **Italy enacted the EU\u2019s first national AI law** aligned with the EU AI Act. This law mandates traceability, human oversight, parental consent for minors under 14, and criminal penalties for harmful deepfakes. It also includes a \u20ac1 billion support fund, setting a concrete national framework for AI compliance in Europe[1].\n\n- **Work has begun on guidance for labeling AI-generated content** under the EU AI Act. This involves embedding cryptographic digital watermarks and metadata to ensure authenticity and traceability of synthetic content, with additional obligations for deepfake disclosures to prevent public deception[1].\n\n- **Advances in LLM summarization** continue, with research benchmarking 20 recent language models for news summarization tasks, using multifaceted evaluation methods including human and AI-based assessments. Techniques to improve summarization quality include fine-tuning, prompt engineering, chunking, and self-reflection to reduce factual errors[2][4][6][8].\n\n- **Security efforts for LLMs** are progressing, with companies like NSFOCUS showcasing new AI defense technologies aimed at securing large language models throughout their lifecycle[7].\n\n- Additionally, LLMs are being applied in healthcare to forecast patient health trajectories, enabling digital twin technologies for personalized medicine[9].\n\nThese developments reflect ongoing efforts to enhance transparency, regulation, practical applications, and security of large language models and AI systems globally.",
